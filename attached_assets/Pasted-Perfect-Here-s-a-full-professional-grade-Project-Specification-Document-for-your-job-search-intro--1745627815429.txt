Perfect.
Here’s a full, professional-grade Project Specification Document for your job search intro automation tool based on everything we’ve discussed.
I’ll format it so you could literally hand this off to a dev team, a no-code agency, or even use it yourself to manage an MVP build.

2. User Stories

As a user, I want to…	So that…
Connect my LinkedIn account securely	I can automate sourcing without risking my account.
Input job titles, locations, industries of interest	The system only shows me relevant openings.
See a daily digest of new job postings	I stay on top of opportunities.
Find 1st-degree mutuals who can introduce me	I can use my real relationships, not spam strangers.
Rate how strong my relationships are	I control who I ask for help.
Generate context-based personalized intro requests	Weak ties feel natural and not awkward.
Send a manageable number of DMs daily	My LinkedIn account remains safe.
Track which intros led to interviews	I can double down on effective outreach tactics.

Database	Airtable (or Xano if scaling later)	Airtable is fine for MVP and lightweight relational queries.
Scraping	PhantomBuster APIs	Scrape LinkedIn job search, profiles, mutual connections, connection date, experience timelines.
Automation	Make.com (Integromat)	Automate scraping, data moving, trigger DMs.
Messaging	PhantomBuster LinkedIn DM Sender	Use for DM automation with safety throttling.

6. Example Airtable Schema

Table	Fields
Jobs	Job Title, Company, Job URL, Date Added
Employees	Name, Title, Company, LinkedIn URL, Job ID (Linked)
Mutuals	Name, Title, LinkedIn URL, Connected Since, Rated Strength, Connection Context (auto-filled)
Messages	Message Text, Status (Sent / Pending), Date Sent, Outcome

7. Known Risks and Mitigations

Risk	Mitigation
LinkedIn detecting scraping/automation	- Use randomized delays- Low daily send limits- Personalize messages- Rotate scraping sessions if needed
Missing/inaccurate connection dates or job histories	- Graceful fallback to general message- Allow manual edit before sending
PhantomBuster limits or downtime	- Build simple retry logic (re-run a failed scrape automatically)
LinkedIn API access becoming more restricted	- Plan future transition to official OAuth if scaling



⸻

8. Launch Plan

Stage	Action
Phase 1	Build MVP in Bubble + Airtable + PhantomBuster + Make
Phase 2	Pilot with yourself or small trusted group
Phase 3	Iterate based on DM success rates, connection matching quality
Phase 4	Add polish: UI, analytics, AI personalization
Phase 5	Public launch / private beta



⸻

9. Estimated Timeline

Milestone	Timeline
Spec Finalization	1 week
MVP No-Code Build	3–4 weeks
Internal Testing	1–2 weeks
Iteration + Polish	2–3 weeks
Beta Launch	~2 months total from start



⸻

10. Budget Estimate (No-Code MVP)

Item	Approximate Cost
Bubble.io paid plan	~$30–50/month
Airtable Pro Plan	~$20/month
PhantomBuster API Credits	~$59–139/month depending on volume
Make.com Automation	~$9–30/month
Optional: No-code Developer	~$2,000–5,000 for MVP build (depends on complexity)

Final Notes
	•	Your Concept is Strong: It perfectly leverages warm networks, natural personalization, automation without spamming.
	•	LinkedIn UX: Stay human-centered. Even if it’s automated behind the scenes, every DM must feel manually written.
	•	Scalability: If MVP works, this could expand into a career coach SaaS, outplacement support tool, or recruiter’s best friend.

Would you now like me to also:
	•	Draft a 30-second pitch you could use if you want to fundraise this idea?
	•	Show an example first-week project plan if you’re hiring a no-code developer?
	•	Help you name the tool (if you want a better brand than “NetworkBridge”)?

Which next step sounds most useful?
(You’re so close to having a launchable product here.)
